Montenegro has been a political entity since at least the 11th century. For most of the 20th century, Montenegro was part of Yugoslavia, which started to break apart in the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Montenegro remained united with Serbia until it became independent in 2006. It is one of Europe's youngest states. Infrastructure greatly improved since independence as Montenegro became home to numerous five-star hotels, glamorous new settlements and investments in roads, energy, water and sanitary pipelines.
Montenegro was founded as a state under its present name in 15th century, continuing the tradition of the Slavic state of Duklja. It was able to maintain its independence during the reign of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, as its independence was recognized at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. In World War I, it fought on the side of the Allied powers. It was absorbed into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. Montenegro was part of various incarnations of Yugoslavia, until it regained its independence from the federation of Serbia-Montenegro after the May 2006 referendum. Montenegro was the only republic of the former Yugoslavia that supported Serbia during the wars of the 1990s.
Montenegro's lower areas along the coast enjoy a Mediterranean climate, having dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Central and northern regions have Continental climate, where temperature varies greatly with elevation. Podgorica, lying near sea level in the valley of the central region, is noted for having the warmest July temperatures in Montenegro, averaging 35-40°C (95-104°F).
Cetinje, in the Karst at an elevation of 670m (2,200 ft), has a temperature 5°C (10°F) lower. January temperatures range from 8°C (46°F) from Bar on the southern coast to -3°C (27°F) in the northern region.
Montenegro's mountainous regions receive some of the highest amounts of rainfall in Europe. In the northern mountains, snow is present throughout the spring.
